Here is a sample project presenting an unexpected behaviour after upgrading from spring boot 3.1.X to 3.2.X
This issue seems to be generated by the hibernate fix [HHH-16768](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16768)

Entity with a field using a jakarta.persistence.Convert may generate an issue if this field is use as criteria in a JPA query method.

This project contains 2 reprositories :
* [WorkingEntityRepository](https://github.com/tcordel/JpaWithConverters/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/issue/WorkingEntityRepository.java): with a working request using @Query
* [BuggyEntityRepository](https://github.com/tcordel/JpaWithConverters/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/issue/BuggyEntityRepository.java): with the associated JPA query method (non working) 

This code is still working until spring boot 3.1.12 (hibernate 6.2.25), down since 3.2.0 (hibernate 6.3.1 - 6.5.2)
